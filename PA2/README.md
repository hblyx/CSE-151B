data.py, neuralnet.py, and train.py are required to run the PA2notebook.ipynb

Specifically, data.py contains methods handling data, neuralnet.py is codes which construct neural networks. 
train.py contains codes for training and experiments.

main.py implemented the train_mlp and check_gradient. But rest part are implemented in the notebook for visualize results.

PA2notebook.ipynb integrated all parts of experiments including pre-process of data. Thus, it is better to look at PA2notebook instead of main.py.
